* Renamed package to plone.versioningbehavior (see dexterity mailing list)

  CMFEdition's trunk.
  [19.10.2009, jbaumann]

* Renamed the behavior marker interface IVersionOnSave to IVersioningSupport
  because it depends on the "version" settings in the types control panel if
  a content is automatically versioning on saving or not. The marker interface
  should only indicate if the type could be versioned or not.
