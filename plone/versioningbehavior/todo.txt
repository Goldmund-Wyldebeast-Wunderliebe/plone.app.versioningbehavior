====

[ ] The History-Action should be visible if a object is versioned.

[ ] The event handler create_initial_version_after_adding does work for
    dexterity objects with an AT-object as parent, it's not working for objects
    with dexterity objects as parent

[ ] if no changes are made but the editform is saved,
    portal_repository.isUpToDate returns False but should return True. that
    results in too many new versions

[ ] Write some tests for the behavior and the event handlers
